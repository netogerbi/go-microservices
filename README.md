# Golang Microservices

This is a case study about basic implementation microservices using Golang language to practice the technology usage like DB connection, messaging queues, gRPC, REST APIs, Docker environment including image for production, packages usage, etc. This project don't have the usage of the best practices, once I'm focusing more on Golang langague generic configuration and usage.

As far as I could see, it's needed to open the project using the workspace file so vscode will be able to recognize imports and packages correctly. To do it open the vscode, click on "File" menu and click on "Open workspace from file..." and select the "go-microservices.code-workspace" file.
